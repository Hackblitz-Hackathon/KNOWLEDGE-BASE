Creating a service using Spring Boot to validate JSON against the provided schema involves several steps.
We will use the json-schema-validator library to validate the JSON data against the schema.
Here's a step-by-step guide to building this service:

Step 1: Set Up a Spring Boot Project
You can set up a Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr or your preferred IDE. For this example, we'll use Maven.

Go to Spring Initializr.
Choose the following options:
Project: Maven
Language: Java
Spring Boot: 3.x.x (latest stable version)
Dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Boot DevTools
Click "Generate" to download the project, then unzip it and open it in your IDE.
Step 2: Add Dependencies
Add the json-schema-validator dependency to your pom.xml file:

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.networknt</groupId>
    <artifactId>json-schema-validator</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.71</version>
</dependency>

Step 3: Create the Schema File
Create a JSON schema file named schema.json in the src/main/resources directory - DataSchema.json.

Step 4: Create a Service to Validate JSON
Create a service class to handle JSON validation - JsonValidationService.java.

Step 5: Create a REST Controller
Create a REST controller to expose an endpoint for JSON validation - JsonValidationController.

Step 6: Run the Application
Run your Spring Boot application. You can use your IDE or run it from the command line with: mvn spring-boot:run

Step 7: Test the Service
You can test your JSON validation service using a tool like Postman or curl.

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/validate -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "Output": {
    "format": "JSON"
  },
  "Columns": [
    {
      "column_name": "UserID",
      "datatype": "integer",
      "data_category": "identifier"
    }
  ]
}'

Summary
You now have a basic Spring Boot application that validates JSON against a schema using the json-schema-validator library.
The service reads the schema from a file, and the REST controller provides an endpoint for validating JSON payloads.
