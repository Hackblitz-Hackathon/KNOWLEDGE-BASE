To enhance your validation service to include pattern validation and ensure possible_values align with datatype and conditions, follow these steps:

1. Validate Regex Pattern
To ensure that the regex pattern in conditions is valid, you'll need to add a method to compile and test regex patterns. If the pattern is invalid, it should be captured and reported.

2. Validate possible_values Based on datatype and conditions
You need to validate that possible_values match the datatype and conditions specified for each column. This involves checking whether the values conform to the expected data type and any constraints specified in conditions.

Updated JsonValidationService Class
Here's how you can modify the JsonValidationService class to include these additional validations.

Explanation
validateJson Method:
Validates the JSON against the schema.
Adds errors from schema validation.
Iterates through Columns to validate individual columns for possible values and regex patterns.

validateColumn Method:
Checks each column for valid possible_values according to its datatype.
Validates the pattern in conditions to ensure itâ€™s a valid regex.

validateDataType Method:
Validates if a given value matches the expected datatype.

Error Handling:
Collects and returns validation errors, including regex syntax issues and datatype mismatches.

Additional Considerations
More Data Types: If you have more complex data types, add additional cases in validateDataType.
Detailed Error Messages: Adjust error messages for better clarity as needed.

Extended Conditions: 
Add more validation rules if conditions involve additional constraints.
This setup will help ensure that your JSON data adheres to both the schema and specific rules for regex patterns and possible values.
